The Online Examination System is a Java-based project designed to provide a flexible and user-friendly platform for conducting online exams. It enables educators, trainers, and organizations to create and administer multiple-choice question (MCQ) exams efficiently. This project aims to simplify the exam management process and enhance the user experience for both examiners and examinees.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can log in securely with their credentials (username and password) to access the system.

Profile Management: Users can update their profile information, including their full name and password.

Exam Creation: Educators and administrators can create exams by adding MCQs, specifying correct answers, and setting time limits.

Timer and Auto-Submit: Examinees have a predetermined time limit to complete the exam. The system includes a timer, and exams are auto-submitted upon reaching the time limit.

Exam Taking: Examinees can select answers for MCQs, submit their responses, and receive immediate feedback on their performance.

Scoring: The system calculates and displays the exam score based on the number of correct answers.

Logout: Users can log out of the system to ensure the security of their accounts.
